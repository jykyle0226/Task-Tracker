Task Tracker

This program is my first project using React. I tried to use basic React fundamentals with Javascript that I've learned from Coding Bootcamp.

This Task Tracker features:

1. Enabling the "Adding a new task" tab by clicking the "ADD" button
2. Saving a new task and Displaying it by clicking the "Save Task" button
3. Closing the "Add new task" tab by clicking the Close button
4. Setting reminders by checking the "Set reminder" checkbox or by double-clicking the task on the display
5. Reminder enabled tasks are indicated by green bars on the left side of the task
6. deleting a task by clicking the "x" button


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
